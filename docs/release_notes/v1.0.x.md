# v1.0.x series (current stable)

## v1.0.0 (29th September 2025)

This major release is a milestone with minor changes compared
to [v0.31.0](./v0.31.x.md).

```{warning}
The {func}`eradiate.run` now returns values more consistently according to the
processed measures. In rare cases, this can be a breaking change. See below for
details.
```

### Changed

* ⚠️ 🖥️ The {meth}`.Experiment.contexts`, {meth}`.Experiment.context_init` and
  {meth}`.Experiment._context_kwargs` properties have been turned into regular
  methods, effectively allowing to pass additional contextual information when
  calling them ({ghpr}`515`).

### Fixed

* Improved kernel context generation to avoid unnecessary processing in some
  multi-measure setups ({ghpr}`515`).
* ⚠️ Improved {func}`eradiate.run` return value consistency ({ghpr}`516`).

## v1.0.2 (upcoming release)

### Added

* The {class}`AstroObjectIllumination` class now has the additional factory
  alias `astroobject`, consistent with the associated Mitsuba plugin
  ({ghpr}`529`).

### Changed

* The {class}`ParticleLayer` class's constructor now warns if the specified
  reference wavelength (default: 550 nm) is missing from the `w` coordinate of
  the aerosol optical property dataset ({ghpr}`530`).
