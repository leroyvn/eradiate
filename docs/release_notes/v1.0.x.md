# v1.0.x series (current stable)

## v1.0.0 (29th September 2025)

This major release is a milestone with minor changes compared
to [v0.31.0](./v0.31.x.md).

```{warning}
The {func}`eradiate.run` now returns values more consistently according to the
processed measures. In rare cases, this can be a breaking change. See below for
details.
```

### Changed

* ⚠️ 🖥️ The {meth}`.Experiment.contexts`, {meth}`.Experiment.context_init` and
  {meth}`.Experiment._context_kwargs` properties have been turned into regular
  methods, effectively allowing to pass additional contextual information when
  calling them ({ghpr}`515`).

### Fixed

* Improved kernel context generation to avoid unnecessary processing in some
  multi-measure setups ({ghpr}`515`).
* ⚠️ Improved {func}`eradiate.run` return value consistency ({ghpr}`516`).

## v1.0.1 (upcoming release)

### Added

* Added a
  `Matplotlib style sheet <https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/customizing.html#using-style-sheets>`__
  ({ghpr}`523`).
* Enabled all of Mitsuba's reconstruction filters ({ghpr}`524`).

### Fixed

* Fixed post-processing pipeline raising with Hamilton v1.89 ({ghpr}`522`).
