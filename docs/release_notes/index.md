# Release notes

```{note}
Although Eradiate does not strictly follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/),
we aim to maintain interface stability, refrain from introducing breaking
changes unless strictly necessary (*i.e.* to correct severe issues) and test
continuously against regressions on a variety of common scenarios.

Updates are tracked in this change log. Every time you decide to update to a
newer version, we recommend that you to go through the list of changes.
We try hard to remain backward-compatible and warn in advance for deprecation
when necessary—we also advise to not ignore `DeprecationWarning`s.

Emoji marks have the following meaning:

* ⚠️ Requires particular attention during upgrade or usage
  (breaking change or experimental feature).
* 📖 Documentation-related change.
* 🖥️ This is a developer-facing change.
