## This is an example of configuration file for Eradiate.
## All settings below can be set using environment variables with the
## `ERADIATE_` prefix (e.g. the `progress` setting can be set with the
## `ERADIATE_PROGRESS` variable).
##
## The configuration module will look for a file named `eradiate.toml`
## in the current working directory, then walk up the file system until it finds
## one.

##                           CONFIGURATION STARTS HERE
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Default azimuth convention
## (see https://eradiate.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rst/user_guide/conventions.html#azimuth-definition-conventions)
azimuth_convention = "east_right"

## Progress information display
## (from least to most verbose: none, spectral_loop or kernel)
progress = "spectral_loop"

## Offline mode switch: if true, data download attempts will be suppressed
offline = false

## List of paths to always prepend to the file resolver (will be searched first)
## If you use the corresponding environment variable, use ":" as a separator
## E.g. ERADIATE_PATH="/some/path:/some/other/path"
path = []

## Absolute path to downloaded data folder. The default is ~/.cache/eradiate/
data_path = "~/Downloads/eradiate/"

## Path to data registry URL
data_url = "https://eradiate-data-registry.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/registry-v1/"

[absorption_database.error_handling]
# Each coordinate in the absorption database is associated an error handling
# policy. For each issue (missing coordinate [missing], missing dimension
# [scalar] or out-of-bounds query [bounds]), the error is handled either raising
# an exception [raise], emitting a warning [warn] or silently ignoring the issue
# [ignore].
# This configuration ignores bound errors on pressure and temperature variables
# because this usually occurs at high altitude, where the absorption coefficient
# is very low and can be safely forced to 0.
p = { missing = "raise", scalar = "raise", bounds = "ignore" }
t = { missing = "raise", scalar = "raise", bounds = "ignore" }
# Ignore missing molecule coordinates, raise on bound error.
x = { missing = "ignore", scalar = "ignore", bounds = "raise" }
